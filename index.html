                current website, and then to test the redesign. Some feedback given was used in high fidelity iterations
                or slated for phase two of the project. Things like more use of iconography or images of the types of
                payments that can be used for the donation module.</div>

                Moving into our next phase of design, using our new theme and user-centric methodology, the Volunteer
